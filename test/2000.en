i also assume that you , commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .
i cannot imagine the commission taking initiatives in order to de-europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but i have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .
in general , i am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .
it is true , there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way .
the commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
but i still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .
so , i would like to hear more about how the commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the white paper to be feasible .
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
in the white paper , you state that the commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?
thirdly , i would like to know whether the commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
i have particular concerns regarding the fate of smes which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case , one has got to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector .
fourthly , i would like to be informed of why the commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .
they are still in training , as it were .
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market ?
sixthly and lastly , i would remind you of a point that i have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .
if the commission implements the white paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .
is the commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all member states legal privilege ?
commissioner , i am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and i hope that , in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit .
mr president , i would like , in beginning my speech regarding the white paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr von wogau .
the fact that the group of the party of european socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the white paper .
since the treaty entered into force , community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy .
after almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion .
for this reason , modernisation was essential .
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons .
firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .
i have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or prohibitions , is something less than a valid system .
national competition authorities were able to apply articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
however , they could not apply article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of article 81 ( 1 ) .
you will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the court of justice , both brought by german courts , which question the feasibility of applying 81 ( 1 ) without being able to apply 81 ( 3 ) .
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 1762 .
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
the fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure , that it did not establish time limits , that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files , or that the right to defence was not properly recognised , were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform .
the court of justice accepted some time ago that community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the member states and in 1994 , the commission published a communication on this subject .
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape .
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight . at the moment , with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them , the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important .
secondly , regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
however , if some of the amendments are accepted , particularly those presented by the ppe-de group , we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document , lacking in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support .
mr president , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , i would like to comment on the one mentioned by mr berenguer , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the commission ' s white paper .
frankly , i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
various arguments have been presented in its favour .
mr berenguer made a very accurate analysis , justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the member states , are truly identical in all regions .
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market .
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .
mr president , i would like firstly to express my appreciation to the commission for the improvement represented by the xxviiith report on competition policy in the union , when compared to previous reports .
i would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , mr rapkay , who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way .
i would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the basque country , which i represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .
i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .
mr president , i would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the member states is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .
this is why i give this report my full support .
recently , i have noticed that the commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .
i would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for europe ' s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in europe in general .
mr president , for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the european union .
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
during my six months as a member of this parliament , i have become acutely aware of the determination of many members to drive forward what is described as the european project .
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe .
but all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true european single market .
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission 's proposals .
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti .
we look to him as the man to root out cartels .
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .
that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs , mr von wogau .
i want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side !
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
so although i may not share his conclusions , i believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address .
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
i know that the commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities . i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
i asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court .
well , we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment .
we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment , in which we have the support of the commission .
unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point , in the factortame case , in which the british government was the defendant , it took ten years for the european court to give a ruling .
so , judicially , something needs to be done .
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .
it is important that business has legal certainty .
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently .
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
i must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the united kingdom .
we all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
i would also ask the commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more european policy .
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change .
we have been told how , currently , people 's time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
but i really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
finally , we , as british conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that .
mr president , the european union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began .
it is an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of european integration , between solidarity and cooperation between member states , with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the european union as an entity .
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
we can be proud of a european competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits .
that is why we should bear in mind what was said by the french writer vivienne forestier , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror .
society is surrendering itself to the economy .
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union .
we are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 usd 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the usa or japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .
european competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .
in common with the other members , i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken .
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
i welcome the fact that commissioner monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the european parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .
then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to european competition policy , and brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement .
emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis .
at the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives .
a word on the white paper : the revision of articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
i am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this house and indeed the majority of my own group , because i believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and i believe there is a threat of renationalisation .
the system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .
the problem of overwork highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty .
mr president , i am very glad that mrs randzio-plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .
for example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the european area was eur 1.4 trillion , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last european merger boom in 1990 .
this poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which i hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .
commissioner monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the eldr group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .
delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what mr von wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the european element , and , particularly would ask the commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that .
mr president , in the limited time i have , i would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by mr jonckheer , who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid .
i also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .
as a member for the basque country , i would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .
i say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the commission in general , and mr monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentives to basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid .
mr president , commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
we need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth-running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally-friendly products .
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .
i often have the impression , unlike the country i come from - former east germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics .
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .
but a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .
i will give you an example : the european union was right to support the grönitz steelworks in brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .
but these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany .
anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .
it goes without saying that that is not what the european union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics .
indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
to that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .
mr president , ever since i was elected to this parliament in 1994 i have never witnessed a report which had such anti-irish sentiments and overtones as the jonckheer report which we are debating today .
i would like to quote verbatim from the report : " state aid per capita is highest in italy , germany and ireland . ireland clearly is in the lead when national and community regional and social funds are put together . "
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
i should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within europe .
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .
i welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for smes for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in objective 1 regions in europe post-2000 .
i remind mr jonckheer that irish companies or foreign companies in ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland european marketplace .
no other member state is at such a disadvantage .
mr president , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe .
the commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something i would wholeheartedly agree with .
but opinion differs as to the solution .
the commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
in other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
we would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something i consider to be unacceptable .
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .
competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of article 81 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union allow .
the requirement to lodge applications in brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the commission will be completely in the dark in future .
this is unacceptable to my mind .
the commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and member states ' courts .
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy .
this is unacceptable in my view .
it would weaken a key element of european policy .
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .
in any case , the commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties .
there was no majority for this at the time .
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .
forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and i am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of europe ' s consumers .
i consider this to be unacceptable .
mr president , in this important debate on competition , i am speaking this morning with particular reference to mr langen ' s document on the steel aid code .
as the court of justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances .
indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that i compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the european steel sector .
this is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses , even if this was in contradiction of article 4 of the ecsc treaty .
this indeed , is the aim of the sixth steel aid code , but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
in the same category of ideas , it is essential that member states fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .
the commission suggests shorter deadlines . i agree with this request .
like the rapporteur , while i am pleased with the commission report , nonetheless i deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the code .
in the interests of equality , either the code must be applied or it must be modified .
finally , and in conclusion , mr president , with the expiry of the ecsc treaty , the regulations will have to be reviewed since i think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case i am in favour of a council regulation which will ensure security in this area .
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission ' s proposals on this matter .
mr president , i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
firstly , i agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
we agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth steel aid code , the commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that code .
however , the thing that worries us most , mr president , is the decrease in prices , by 30 % , owing to imports .
the reason for this decrease is unfair competition from south korea and taiwan , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .
orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .
i live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems : asturias .
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
i know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in europe and outside it .
mr president , commissioner , director-general , i would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von wogau report : i welcome the commission ' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .
i congratulate the rapporteur karl von wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .
the white paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the member states , and above all the smes concerned , that need to be clarified .
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and europe as a business location in a global economy .
however , it must be " europeanised " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
i also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the commission giving up any of its responsibility .
in practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94 % of the cases that the commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished , non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the commission is subject to time-related , staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and eu enlargement
i am in suspense as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .
the commission report confirms that , with the exception of germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .
with what aim ?
not to save jobs .
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .
not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .
did these firms need state aid to survive ?
no , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .
state aid is not only counterproductive because , as the jonckheer report acknowledges , it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders .
it is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .
in voting against the jonckheer report , i wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff .
mr president , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .
firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to commissioner monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .
this has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film casablanca ' time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
it is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts .
this is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .
thirdly , it seems to me important that the commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .
fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .
we have seen this in the aborted seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
mr president , commissioner monti , there is much that is good in mr jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .
first of all the report reveals parliament ' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly .
many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from member state to member state reveals the need for surveys such as this .
aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective , uneconomic division of europe ' s meagre resources .
the form the aid takes is important .
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .
for example , state guarantees , on which the commission has just publicised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .
the report on competition policy further stresses the commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .
mr rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
mr president , mr monti , the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the european union , not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years , but also with a forward-looking view to the union ' s enlargement .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for his commitment and i welcome his thoughts .
moreover , i would like to say that i appreciate the remarks and observations that professor tesauro , chairman of the italian competition authority , sent me , and which i am sure mr monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .
as things stand , there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the english , italian and french markets . there is a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy .
another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .
in my opinion , we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed : small and medium-sized businesses , which bind the european economy together , and social protection , which europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy .
safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people ' s quality of life .
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .
we ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with russia and the mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .
i hope - and i thank mr monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .
mr president , competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force .
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .
in his report , karl von wogau manages to capture this very well .
but europe is changing .
the economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25-30 member states .
the european commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy .
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
this is not in question .
having said this , i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
how will the commission , as keeper of the treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in london , palermo , helsinki and , soon , budapest and ankara ?
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given .
it is not enough to say that , in the member states , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .
in the netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .
this country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .
this in contrast to germany , where a very experienced kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market .
the european commission ' s belief that , in all quarters of the union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within catholic circles , we term " foolhardy , " and this is not allowed .
uniformity needs to be worked on .
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
what is the commissioner ' s opinion of this ?
i would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses .
in order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security , the european commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that , alongside vertical exemptions , horizontal exemptions will also be possible .
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .
moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the yellow card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company ' s very existence .
mr president , being the last to speak gives me the privilege , commissioner , of telling you that the majority of this house supports your initiative and has expressed a total , and , i believe , justified , confidence in you at the helm of this boat .
but we all want to be oarsmen on it . we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
i therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform .
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .
firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular mrs randzio-plath , president of the committee on economic affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the treaty .
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed .
secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .
it is true , commissioner , that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
we all agree on this .
but it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this house - that the european industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses , and that the commission often plays the role of auctoritas , of legitimising the nature of the internal market .
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said .
there have only been nine rejections .
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .
in this respect , the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improved upon .
i believe that biodiversity is good , as is cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that is to say , competition law .
here improvements should be made .
only in certain countries , germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
commissioner , it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform .
it transcends competition , it transcends the cohesion of the internal market . i believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of european integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of european integration .
therefore , commissioner , we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i heartily congratulate the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the entire european parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects .
in my opinion , mr president , this joint debate fully bears this out .
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction .
the guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aims to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the european people .
i , personally , would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report .
i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups . i do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .
the groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . i will take these very quickly one at a time .
efficiency : i am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
the proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements , and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .
the question of renationalisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , i would like to point out and stress , several times if i may , that the white paper does not affect mergers or state aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that , as far as regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of renationalisation .
of course we have pondered this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .
the reform will lead to a gradual development - i stress this because i was particularly taken with this term , used by mrs randzio-plath , and , moreover , i fully agree with it - of european competition culture .
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but i do not believe that it should be exaggerated .
as with many other provisions of the treaty , articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and i do not feel that this has created serious problems .
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice .
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .
in this respect , i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs riis-jørgensen and mr huhne of monitoring implementation .
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how ec law is applied by national authorities and courts .
that is why the commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , mrs peijs .
concerning mr evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
the purpose of publishing the white paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .
we have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business .
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance . this was raised by mrs thyssen , mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi : the issue of smes .
many speakers have underlined this .
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes .
why ?
is this simply a political gesture ?
no .
in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most smes will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restraints .
most smes have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
we have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since smes are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under article 81 ( 1 ) .
we are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of smes , and our white paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of smes , first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system , and secondly , by making article 81 ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit smes in particular .
the fourth group is legal certainty . mr evans , legal certainty is , of course - and i am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal professions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of europe .
legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the chair of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , mrs palacio vallelersundi , emphasised in her last intervention - and i am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .
( fr ) mrs thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than i. this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof .
the white paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined : the exchange of confidential information .
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
( it ) i shall now quickly turn , mr president , to mr rapkay ' s report , and i would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the commission ' s xxviiith annual report on competition policy .
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
i will mention only two , in order to be brief .
the first is greater transparency .
parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as i did right from the moment i had my hearing , on 1 september , in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
as regards the international aspect of competition policy , i can confirm , mr rapkay , that the commission is willing to provide parliament with a report on this subject , to which mrs randzio-plath has also drawn our attention .
we have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant american , canadian and japanese authorities as regards competition policy , and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the world trade organisation .
mr jonckheer , i would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union .
i will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean i do not consider it important .
it has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; i am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the intergovernmental conference .
with regard to your suggestions , mr jonckheer , you already know that my staff , who , although short-handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of state aids and the state aids ' scoreboard ' .
i am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey , which , according to the scheduled timeframe , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in january , and for adoption by the commission in march 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .
mr jonckheer , mrs thyssen and mr gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of state aid .
i can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .
i can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , i share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental state aid .
in connection with the issue of state aid , i would also like to take up one of the points raised by mrs riis-jørgensen , among others regarding repayment of illegal aid .
in april 1999 , the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .
in the near future - and i can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .
finally , mr president , i would like to thank mr langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .
i would like to say that , as we know , the commission report on state aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure , pursuant to article 95 of the ecsc treaty , but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector .
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in july 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , i will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .
so , mr president , i will walk away from this debate , for which i am very grateful to parliament , in the knowledge that we have the european parliament ' s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the house , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .
i am especially grateful for all of this . we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs , and , at a more general level , with parliament .
in this regard , i liked your term , mrs palacio vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
competition is not an end in itself , as mr rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in european integration .
as mr von wogau said at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept : it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy .
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the european integration process , as it has done in the past .
thank you , commissioner monti .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
protection under criminal law of the union 's financial interests
the next item is the report ( a5-0002 / 2000 ) by mrs theato , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , containing parliament ' s recommendations to the commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .
mr president , year after year we learn , mainly from the european court of auditors ' test reports , that money is lost to the budget of the european union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage , mismanagement , and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud .
for some time now , these abuses have meant that parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the european taxpayer ' s money , which , when all is said and done , is what sustains the union ' s budget .
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detecting it , punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .
creating uclaf by means of the task force and setting up the anti-fraud office olaf were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the community and on local monitoring .
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
so far , efforts on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures .
since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the member states .
then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual member states , together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
what is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the european council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 member states .
after five years only four have done so .
this state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the union , has inspired parliament to initiate the setting-up of a european public prosecutor ' s office .
there is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equip the union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity .
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .
the concerns of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as articulated in its position , together with those of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .
in addition , we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the union ' s financial interests , and in which main principles are firmly established .
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being 30 september in a proposed amendment .
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
the commission ought - and i have also amended this deadline to 31 may 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the commission , for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body olaf .
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency .
the proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks , which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by olaf into activities which are to the detriment of the union ' s financial interests , and to olaf ' s relationship with the national authorities .
there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the member states .
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
in addition , we call upon the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to take up debate on the establishment of a european public prosecutor ' s office for the protection of the financial interests of the union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts , the so-called corpus juris , and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared .
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called five wise men .
the commission , mr barnier , mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea .
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority .
we can set another example here , to the effect that parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary .
mr president , i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .
i believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area . this moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of article 280 ( 4 ) .
if we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
the treaty is a collection of complex articles . however , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize .
at the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the community ' s financial interests , as mrs theato has explained very well .
we are all aware - and this parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the community . but be careful .
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly .
therefore , in my capacity as president of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , and , of course , as an mep , i hope that a large majority of this house will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the commission .
mr president , this , as mrs theato said , is a critical report .
it is a report that has been proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an own-initiative report .
one of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the european union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement .
it is sometimes exaggerated but there it is . we need to do something about it .
some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the member states - and let us not forget that the member states are responsible for implementing about 80 % of the eu budget .
a lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the convention on the protection of financial interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .
the question is : who prosecutes ?
that is where we really get into difficulty .
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers ?
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states .
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
we are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a european judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions .
of most importance to parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the european union , is how to deal with people who work within the european union institutions .
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio .
i should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the commission should tackle this question .
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor .
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
mr president , i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report . i think it is a first-class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .
but the member states failed to cooperate .
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , i think .
it is now possible , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , that the commission will take new initiatives , and i would like to suggest to the commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor .
my colleague jan-kees wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .
i think what we need is , at european level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
one of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong , especially when it comes to revenue of the european union , then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another .
this , i thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
i would like to make one general point on politics .
whatever we may say about the european elections , the low turnout is a fact .
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly , and this must be done at european level .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
mrs theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in european institutions .
i believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last european elections and of the level of turnout .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
the court of auditors publishes its report , which criticises the member states on account of various incidences of fraud .
so far , however , the european institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
i believe that mrs theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the european institutions take steps to ensure that european money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .
it is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. forming olaf from uclaf - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for olaf , in order that olaf too might operate within a secure legal framework .
we will need the european public prosecutor ' s office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects .
having said all that , i must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity .
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato ' s report receives more support .
mr president , we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled , even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by parliament to the council to amend the treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests can be guaranteed .
the establishment of a european public prosecutor ' s office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the union is doubtless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a european legal system .
indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national states put up to communitisation is , and will be , fierce .
indeed , it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a european legal system .
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .
in any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a community corpus iuris in the treaties .
on behalf of my group , but also personally , i hope that the vital financial spirit of the union will pave the way for the creation of a european legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many states .
therefore , on behalf of my group , i would like to say that we support the theato report ; i nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the igc agenda .
mr president , mrs theato ' s report on the protection of the european union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a european public prosecutor .
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .
but the idea of a european public prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .
moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms .
according to the theato report , the european public prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office , olaf .
at the same time , however , we see from the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a european union court .
in this way , a small european reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a european criminal law and then , why not a european minister of justice , supervised by an extension of the powers of the european parliament ?
i therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .
in the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a european public prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form , organised around a superstate .
the union for a europe of nations group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric europe with nations linked in a network .
and such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national teams specialising in offences involving community finances .
so the legal framework , mr president , is already in place .
it is fine , in principle . it need only be fine-tuned .
mr president , mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution : a european criminal code with crimes against the community and a european prosecutor-general .
mrs theato probably forgot to include a european prison now that we have the fbi , the european police , in the form of olaf .
all this would be established by two regulations , one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code . the regulations would be adopted pursuant to article 280 of the treaty , i.e. based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .
and indeed there is a twofold shift .
firstly , the classic eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single vat , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .
all this to combat fraud worth less than eur 1 billion , while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the generalised system of preferences , free trade areas , customs presents to chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource , gdp , as a result of the budgetary rationing pact .
next we have the puritan shift : the teutonic europe of the north , the europe of the lutherans , calvinists and quakers , wishes to inflict its moral order on us .
basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .
mr president , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union , more so these days than there used to be .
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe ' s citizens .
the credibility of the efforts we make here in parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .
this does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law .
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the member states and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity .
there is no doubt that i myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at european level .
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage .
now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in recommendations i and ii of the report , is actually about taking action in the eu ' s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the member states ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly .
the compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned .
taking these aspects into account , i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf .
mr president , will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving eu funds ?
i do not believe so .
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as proposed at the last summit .
in the way it is structured , eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes .
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
olaf , europol and the treaty on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters should be used fully and , when the fraud convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the member states , we can also achieve a lot with this .
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified this agreement .
it is simply too bad , and i can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common european public prosecutor ' s office instead .
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office .
it is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions !
mr president , we all want to do something about combating european fraud .
but the question is now : is the european union doing anything about it as well ?
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .
the tampere summit was about combating crime .
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
there is no european anti-fraud legislation in force because the member states , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .
so a great deal has to be done in this area .
and what exactly should be done ?
two things , and mrs theato ' s report clearly spells these out .
firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union .
so , unification in this small area .
secondly , we should indeed set up a european public prosecutor ' s office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosecutors , helping bring criminal proceedings in european fraud cases and , secondly , to supervise europol and olaf in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .
the european public prosecutor ' s office is nothing to be afraid of . i feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on .
it is , in fact , something very positive .
just like europol .
europol , involving police cooperation , does not rank above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .
this is exactly the task which a small , limited , european public prosecutor ' s office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .
parliament supports this .
the committee of wise men supports this .
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same .
mr president , i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue .
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
the idea of a european public prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in ireland and the uk .
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about .
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget .
but when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in san sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists , with no media invited - the president of the european parliament at the time , mr gil-robles gil-delgado , said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend eu competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity .
we need a public debate on this .
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed .
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed .
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate .
mr president , on behalf of the italian radical members , i abstained on this text in the committee on budgetary control , because i share the concerns that have been voiced , in such an authoritative way , by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law .
with this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for community fraud to be curbed , to be crushed .
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of its chair , mrs theato , will not be without its critics .
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
article 280 of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .
nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this . that is to say , they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .
we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee .
mr president , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the european parliament , during the plenary sittings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .
today , something has changed , at least in terms of mechanisms , and especially as regards monitoring , but we are still not satisfied , particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a european public prosecutor , crimes , fraud , the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one ' s office at european level .
i feel that we must clearly safeguard the community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of community life .
for this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states .
in this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a european public prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .
today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular points .
firstly , i would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of member states , although i am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of british television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system .
sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but i digress .
the point i want to make relates to mrs theato ' s report .
i believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the european union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as european criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities .
i am referring to recommendations 1 and 2 . after all , there is no longer mention of a european public prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , european authority , or " body " to quote mrs theato .
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
we also face difficulties with regard to offences .
nothing has changed there .
as has always been the case , there are offences that transcend european offences , as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include money-laundering , receiving stolen goods , and forming a criminal organisation .
as far as that is concerned , i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .
what parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the commission and council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs .
mr president , for years , parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .
frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the convention ( and of the protocols relating to this protection ) which , five years after being signed , has still not been ratified and has still not come into force .
on the other hand , more pro-active attempts , such as olaf , which is currently operating , have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .
the proposals in mrs theato ' s report seek to encourage the commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the community budget . these proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole community .
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by olaf , without harming the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the european court of justice .
finally , following on from what was agreed in tampere , the report restates the need for a european public prosecutor . this issue has been brought once again to the fore by commissioner vitorino ' s timely decision to ask the igc to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .
we should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the union ' s financial system with a substantive and procedural european law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the community ' s economic life .
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically community-wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the member states ?
as there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the igc agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the european public prosecutor ?
surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
mr president , the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged . to remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .
at the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the eu must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few member states .
we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .
on the other hand , i am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .
in the present situation , i am therefore sceptical about the idea of a european prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
we have more confidence in eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .
the major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered .
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten ' s report .
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .
the major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .
this requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
mr president , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the european institutions and in european politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .
parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
on behalf of the commission i am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the european union .
on ratifying the amsterdam treaty , all member states stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the european union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment . yet as things stand , only the first four member states have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 .
the commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
a legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and i will therefore advise the commission to examine this step with all due haste .
olaf , the european anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .
accordingly , the commission refused to put up with the fact that both european banks , the ecb and the eib , contested the right of olaf to include these two institutions in its investigations , citing their independent status .
this is why the commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and i hope that parliament approves this step .
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions .
it is the task of the monitoring committee for olaf , which was set up at the same time as olaf , to safeguard the independence of olaf , however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by olaf .
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
in other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and i will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .
there is one thing i would ask though : i believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for olaf from leading to the misconception that olaf does not now have enough authority .
no , there must be no undermining of olaf ' s authority , and neither do i think this was the rapporteur ' s intention .
as such , i would ask you to give olaf ' s work your full support , also in its present form .
thank you , commissioner schreyer .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
vote
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
heaton-harris ( ppe-de ) .
mr president , on a point of order i should like to ask you for clarification of the rules of procedure : namely rules 133 ( 2 ) and 138 ( 4 ) .
these are both about voting .
is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ?
that is quite right , mr heaton-harris . i put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it .
in this particular case , i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .
mr president , i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
it is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .
i know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
i shall , i assure you , mr heaton-harris , pay particular attention to the show of hands .
i hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote .

explanations of vote- own resources
.
( fr ) the european union is apparently financed through four own resources .
the european budget is effectively sourced from vat and on the basis of gdp , especially now that the community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy , which had already been cut back drastically by the generalised system of preferences .
since then , community vat fraud and distortions in the calculation of gdp , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of community resources .
since then , of course , this europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the commission .
furthermore , the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying member states .
this is a long way from offshoots such as the " community criminal code " , the " european public prosecutor " or a european police force , with olaf .
there is as yet no federal european tax .
all the same , a europe with 25 members will be wanting a european tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on co2 to finance the budget for 2025 .
koch report ( a5-0105 / 1999 )
- ( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .
in recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
it therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .
directive 96 / 35 / ec was a response to this requirement .
firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport is involved .
in order to facilitate achieving this objective , directive 96 / 35 / ec provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .
while this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .
it therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised , high-level training of safety advisers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different member sates .
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised . it outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .
parliament voted in favour of this text . it did , however , table a number of amendments , most of which were adopted in the council ' s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the ' specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body ' .
in order to be realistic , i further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .
i shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .
koch report ( a5-0104 / 1999 )
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then .
essentially , my opinion is as follows : i deplore the fact that , in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods , we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment .
i shall point out that a directive on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 january 1997 .
this included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 january 1999 .
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .
in line with the usual procedure , it is the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the european agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road signed in geneva in 1957 ( known generally as adr ) , applicable throughout europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the eu .
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted . consequently , the commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems , rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements , as should have been the case !
this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .
until then , there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations .
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable european standards .
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .
schroedter report ( a5-0108 / 1999 )
mr president , i wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development .
i would urge both the member states and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in europe .
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .
despite the fact that the community , through the structural funds among others , injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in europe , these disparities continue to exist .
i therefore wonder whether the community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .
mr president , in relation to the schroedter report , i am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by mr barnier , that the rules on additionality concerning structural funds apply only at the level of member states and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside member states in favour of self-governing regions such as wales or scotland .
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
i want it to be clear that though i voted in favour of the report , i have this important reservation .
- the schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of eu structural funds in europe for the period 2000-2006 .
i believe that this is particularly important as eu structural funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds .
as a member of the european parliament for the constituency of leinster , i have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national eu funds .
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .
i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of european structural funds .
for example , we have seen the success of the leader i and leader ii schemes in ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of ireland and within europe .
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
the leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas .
this is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .
the european peace and reconciliation fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in ireland .
once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .
during the next round of eu structural funds 2000-2006 , other eu initiatives such as " equal " and " urban " will be operating .
these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best european structural funds should be spent .
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new eu structural fund plans and programmes . they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , european and local funding .
.
( fr ) this report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
but more especially because , even though at first sight the european market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
jacques delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
this is a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affairs , drawn up in collaboration with member states , regions and local communities , with the commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show member states what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming .
this is why i shall support this report , despite regretting the fact that , for timetabling reasons , the european parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist member states , regions and local communities in the programming of objectives 1 , 2 and 3 .
moreover , i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs , adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .
mrs schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
it highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved , chiefly those involved at a local level , who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems , hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships , which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned .
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the member states , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
in order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include members of the european parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid .
amended again as such by the schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .
in the meantime , let us support this first step .
- this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some member states .
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
in my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping .
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .
if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all europeans , then we must have a level playing field .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
there are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained .
whether we are talking about beef to france or about backhanders to industry , eu member states must not be allowed to flout the law .
i enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a " scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per member state .
countries that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed .
member states cannot be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
i take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling .
much remains to be done , however , and i call on the commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of europe .
.
( pt ) the commission ' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the structural funds and the cohesion fund . it is therefore crucial that the european parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective member states .
unfortunately , the european commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight .
it is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions , of which the portuguese regions of the azores and madeira are examples . this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .
the truth is though , that the commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
in the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
in this respect , the commission document has shortcomings , as it makes no recommendation to the member states to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .
smes , micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still " weak operators " , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some member states , including italy , are major obstacles to accessing structural funds .
this is why the mid-term review , provided for under article 42 of regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .
they merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in community policies , and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities , or candidate countries .
that said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions , we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the objective 1 zones allows , in practice , a policy of integrated interventions , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary .
the guidelines , as adopted by the commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in ascending order , could even put the member states on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .
a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the esf and employment strategy . the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the member states really do need " guidelines " .
i must also stress that once again the commission is , in fact , skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .
berend report ( a5-0107 / 1999 )
.
( pt ) we basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
firstly , and as the commission itself states , it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita gdp between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new german länder in calculating the community average from 1991 onwards . this obviously caused a slight reduction in the union ' s per capita gdp level .
we also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment . this consequently imposes the need for new development strategies , with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area .
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states , which is what the report proposes .
finally , but no less importantly , i would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each state .
the huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same state mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue . this kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional ( and other ) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each member state .
. ( fr ) the berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the european union .
nonetheless , the french members of the union for a europe of nations group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein .
paragraph 26 , for example , " draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the union " .
at a time when , in order to fulfil the convergence criteria , member states are forced to undergo a strict budgetary slimming regime , one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative , the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony .
as an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and emu , the lack of results is put down to the lack of money , with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent .
what can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations , rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects ?
expenditure becomes an end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme .
the statistics published by the european commission in its sixth report do however show , as mr berend pointed out , the limitations of the policy being implemented :
the relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the european union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996 , testifying to a concentration of wealth , jobs and activity in certain areas : hamburg , brussels , antwerp , luxembourg , the paris region , darmstadt , oberbayern , bremen , vienna , karlsruhe and emilia-romagna .
quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated , the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerbate the exodus of population from the most outlying , the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the central axes of the union ( the benelux countries , north west germany , northern italy , the parisian region , etc ) .
the poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment .
in 1986 , the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41 % of the overall community gnp . in 1996 it was 50 % .
progress is particularly marked in portugal and ireland .
in fact , if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor , then it seems that the middle-range regions , covered by objective 2 , are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their gnp , and a worsening of the employment situation .
this phenomenon is particularly marked in france : the gnp of the champagne-ardennes region , which it is my honour to represent , has gone from 105 % to 94 % of the community average , that of the loire region has dropped from 95 % to 91 % , and that of the auvergne from 89 % to 83 % .
this is a generalised tendency , sparing neither the rhône-alpes , nor alsace .
it has been confirmed in sweden and finland , countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years , as in many regions of the united kingdom .
it may therefore seem strange that , when the structural funds were reformed , objective 2 , dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring , should have been sacrificed in favour of objectives 1 and 3 . for the period 1999-2006 , the total appropriation for this objective will be ecu 22.5 billion , a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999 .
based as it is on such choices , it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the member states of the european union .
von wogau report ( a5-0069 / 1999 )
. ( fr ) considering the employment situation in the community and the european union ' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment , the analysis of mergers carried out by the commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .
as an example i would give the restructuring of abb alsthom power . a sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout europe is visiting strasbourg today .
the management of abb alsthom power , following a merger carried out in june 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries .
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the european works council , in existence since 1996 .
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened .
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect , i abstained .
.
( pt ) by proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in community competition policy , the commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion . issues of mergers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .
the position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy , moving towards applying community law in national courts rather than at the european court of justice , and even aims at having specialised courts .
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states .
on the other hand , as the rapporteur points out , in the name of competition policy , public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies , with the privatisation of important industries and public companies , as has happened in portugal , with harmful consequences for the country and its workers .
- ( fr ) the commission ' s white paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec treaty ( now 81 and 82 ) certainly does not propose any " renationalisation " of competition policy , as some members of the european parliament fear .
but it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union .
in fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new member states , the commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at member state level in a more decentralised fashion .
the most remarkable thing , in my view , is the message conveyed by this proposal : that the commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , requires reform of the centralised system .
admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .
indeed , the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
moreover , the von wogau report , which the european parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term .
is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament ?
the german social democrats voted against the von wogau report because , in their view , it might break up european policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the standardising superstate .
curiously , a number of employers agreed with them , preferring the european " one-stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .
indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
but , on the other hand , the wider view must also be taken , namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .
rapkay report ( a5-0078 / 1999 )
the members of parliament from the lutte ouvrière party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy .
competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power .
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the european union , despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the european institutions intend to promote .
the commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the european market is ridiculous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements .
this is repulsive most of all in social terms .
the european commission ' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes .
there is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still !
we acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the european institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .
- ( fr ) in voting against this report , we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in seattle and throughout europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .
we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the paddington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .
this report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .
whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
finally , after seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto ?
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
jonckheer report ( a5-0087 / 1999 )
i am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the eu , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the directorate-general for competition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .
i am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
however , as the rapporteur pointed out , such aid is occasionally essential and may , in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( article 6 of the treaty ) , services of general economic interest ( article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion ( article 158 ) .
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the european commission .
the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of eur 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german länder .
like the rapporteur , i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .
it must also cooperate with the member states in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the ninth report .
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state .
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid .
in order to compensate for this situation , the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .
i shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which i feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one member state to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the eu .
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .
langen report ( a5-0073 / 1999 )
in the important debate on competition this morning , i expressed my views on mr langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth steel aid code .
just as the court of justice recognised in its order of 3 may 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation .
establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable , even though article 4 ( c ) , of the ecsc treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry .
this , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code .
at the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .
in the same way , it is vital for member states to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipulated under article 7 of the steel aid code .
the commission suggests that member states submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminders .
like the rapporteur , i am pleased with the commission report , but i did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .
in the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the steel aid code strictly or modify the code if the commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty .
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .
my feeling in this respect is that only a council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .
for all these reasons i voted in favour of the langen report , and i now await the commission ' s response to our requests and demands .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
oil slick off the french coast
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast .
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission .
mr president , i shall be speaking on behalf of the ppe-de group , but also as an elected representative for brittany , and i am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .
together with mrs grossetête and the ppe-de group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
the erika shipwreck is a truly european issue , firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in europe , with extremely serious consequences for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists , and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a european scale .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline , and why ?
because the americans managed to learn their lesson from the exxon valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the oil pollution act , which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities , as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable , and is more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and , in particular , the existence of the american coastguard .
if , i repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .
this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .
well , if the charterer is exonerated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .
the regulations must therefore be reviewed , and i thank you , commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations .
moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be stepped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .
you told us that rina was an italian classification register recognised by the commission .
what are the conditions for this recognition ?
what guarantees are there of its reliability ?
you are going to commission a fact-finding mission .
we await the outcome with great interest .
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up .
there is a paris memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into european ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries .
why not ?
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
if the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the united states .
firstly , i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team . this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
i could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this parliament but i only have three minutes .
surely it is now about time that not only the member states but that toothless tiger that is known as the international maritime organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year .
how many more erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the european union , not just certain areas of it ?
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ?
how many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any erika-type disaster ?
while i recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague ken stewart used to call ' ships of shame sailing in and out of our european union waters : rust buckets badly crewed ' .
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively .
we need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .
the erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods . just as the sea empress , just as the braer did .
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
my group 's sympathy goes out to the people of brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster , just as my group 's sympathy went out to the people of west wales and to the shetland islands on previous occasions .
is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea .
the time for resolutions has passed . what is now needed is action .
sadly , i fear , the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
mr president , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .
the " erika " incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of europe .
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of europe .
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .
the pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
we need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the " polluter pays " principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .
i agree with every word the commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?
as a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .
mr president , commissioner , i have brought you a small gift . here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the french island of noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows : " with every tide , the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the erika .
with every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick , sticky , black tar .
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident ? "
indeed this disaster involving the erika , like that of the russian vessel in turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available .
it is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the amoco cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , " never again ! "
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
but , listening to you , commissioner , we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992 , i believe , the commission and parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee .
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many .
this is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the european union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes .
we should be aware , for example , that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil .
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of total as charterer not recognised ?
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .
in addition , it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo , as a matter of urgency .
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
finally , a compassionate thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .
i can testify to this remarkable work .
you are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
in relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .
and , on this subject , commissioner , you did not mention how the commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats .
once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .
in the meantime , it is nature that is taking the rap , as always .
mr president , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment .
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of mrs javette-le besque , spokesperson for the oil slick action group " marée noire " , made up of men and women from the french department of morbihan .
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .
among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .
this is no longer tolerable .
next , we have flags of convenience .
according to the international transport federation , over 40 % of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .
this is no longer tolerable .
finally , there is the lack of transparency .
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible .
this is no longer tolerable .
in all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double hull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of member states .
we must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .
i am thinking specifically of total-fina in the present instance .
this is an approach , mr president , which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation .
in so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .
mr president , commissioner , as a member for the french atlantic coast , for vendée , i should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the erika oil slick in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us , but by a crime .
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
because our states , with the blessing of the community , did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience , drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals .
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
obviously , such matters should be handled at world level , but the current international regulations of the imo are far from adequate and are far too loose , and neither our own countries nor the community have tried determinedly to make them stricter , despite previous disasters .
admittedly , there is the international oil pollution compensation fund , iopcf , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo .
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
let me remind you that the erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the european union .
in addition , there are community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .
the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .
the date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . it is now scheduled for july .
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .
the best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select .
secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future .
this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
thus , the erika was refused access to american waters .
if the european community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
let us ensure , mr president , commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media hype and the shock of this house have died down .
mr president , torrey canyon , olympic bravery , haven , amoco cadiz , gino , tanio , so many names we remember with horror .
and now the erika .
whose turn is next ?
twenty one years after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .
the atlantic west coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .
it is hard to understand why the french and the europeans allow something which the americans refuse to accept , and why europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety .
and this is the result .
the erika , a vessel flying a maltese flag , a floating rust bucket , classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the amoco cadiz .
as an elected representative for the loire-atlantique region , unfortunately , i can testify to this .
there is nothing natural about these recurring disasters , they are the result of fate .
they are the result of human thoughtlessness .
what we have here is an ecological disaster .
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .
it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , oyster farmers , shellfish farmers , people who make a living from the salt marshes , shopkeepers , etc .
the erika disaster must be the last in the series .
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get members of parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the commission ?
next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .
in fact , according to the experts , the oil the erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .
we know what actually happened .
next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicles more than five years old .
we must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea .
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group .
mr president , in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .
it is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major european state ; an incident which could happen again at any time .
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks .
the 15 clearly do not suffice .
these guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things . no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the european union again .
all those involved , including the transport agent , are responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .
this is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .
however , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
in other words , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
mr president , may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
many thanks for this .
this also means that , in any case , i have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 january but also for the action points which she announced today .
the erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and european level , nature and the environment come off second-best .
the damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management members .
during the christmas break , when the dutch media received attention for the erika disaster , i had a look , just out of interest , on the internet to see what arrangements were , in fact , already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures , especially after premier jospin had said that europe should do more .
what i learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .
could i highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the commissioner ?
first of all , the port-state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .
i think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place .
so this 25 % should be increased .
furthermore , if a ship is no longer seaworthy , not only should the facts be examined , but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used .
but this is not in place .
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .
finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the united states , ships should in any case be double-hulled .
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and i also think that the marpol treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .
mr president , i would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many ngos that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals .
mr president , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
we have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the european union .
that is why i will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your heads of government and ministers : " you must push this through in the council of ministers " .
allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .
so what are we to do now ?
i have no intention of talking about past events ; rather i want to look to the future .
what are we to do now ?
i will tell you a few things we should do .
of course , we need double-hulled vessels .
that goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
so what do we need to happen immediately ?
we need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .
we need this at european level and internationally ; we need something like a tüv , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in germany , which is compulsory every two years .
if you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .
this is what we need for ships .
thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the european union .
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .
we must reach agreement here , in all the european union ' s ports , from marseilles , through to rotterdam , to wilhelmshaven , cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor .
fourthly , we need the shipowner to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory usd 12 million , but to the value of at least usd 400 million , to be covered per insurance certificate .
we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !
i can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the european union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
environmental standards will be a recurring theme .
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .
the unions will have something to say as will industry .
a long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .
i am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
we need to have a long memory when we say : " for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the european union . "
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time !
mr president , mrs roth-behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .
we have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures .
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
i would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the plimsoll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .
where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?
i consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that mrs roth-behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in europe have brought up for discussion .
we must also critically examine the classification societies . i do not think that we can accept their procedures .
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
finally , i want to say that , when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are units within the commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards .
within the commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
it is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the commission ' s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .
mr president , we shall vote in favour of the gue / ngl group resolution because it denounces total-fina ' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and i endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited , or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers .
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .
how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world uninhabitable ?
how is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments reacting ?
the crux of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the european institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as total-fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .
in these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage .
mr president , i am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .
however , we must stick to the facts .
the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .
i have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the member states do not have enough money to undertake the controls .
i cannot accept this .
if the member states decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
the controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue .
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .
it should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing .
secondly , i also share the commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .
that is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .
mrs roth-behrendt , we already have a tüv ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .
there are reputable companies too .
you will be familiar with some reputable companies , our french fellow meps will be familiar with some reputable companies , but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements , and these must be struck off the list .
finally , we should make it quite plain to malta that if it wants to become a member of this community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements , for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up !
mr president , i welcome the statement from the commissioner .
having spent a lot of time at sea myself i am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika .
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .
it should be noted that the oil industry , through the international oil pollution compensation funds , regards itself as liable under the 1969 convention and its 1992 protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some usd 170 million .
this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
however , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .
in that context i support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
i support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .
calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
mr president , i would like to thank my socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .
because , as well as the irreparable damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry , the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resources , and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover .
it is no accident , commissioner , that the affected areas are always those european regions which are least developed , those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .
these are the same areas , commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts , without any control whatsoever .
i come from a region , galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
brittany and galicia , two european ' lands ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks .
i therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .
on the one hand , by asking the commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .
in this regard , the current process of negotiations on malta ' s accession to the european union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag .
on the other hand , prevention is essential .
portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .
i would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at european level , using all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future .
lastly , mr president , i would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then mayoress , i lived through similar situations .
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and european fishing stocks .
mr president , as chairman of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i should like to congratulate the commission , and in particular commissioner loyola de palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which has really shaken the whole of europe .
we , as the committee on transport , are prepared to discuss the commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .
in addition , i should like to make a number of comments :
first , the commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina , the italian shipping register , because we need to know if community law was applied .
that should be the starting point for our efforts .
secondly , apart from the shipowners ' liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers , for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and , of course , for restoring the damage .
once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
however , this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1 / 3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .
i have no objection to examining an amendment making community law stricter but , as other members have stressed , we need to start with application , because there is already a legal framework at european union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .
this legal framework is fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the member states , under the supervision of the commission , should endeavour to ensure that community law is actually applied .
mr president , commissioner , i believe that the unfortunate incident involving the erika should in fact , as others have said this afternoon , constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the european union where , since 1967 , there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers ; more than one every two years .
the economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the community institutions .
commissioner , i would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .
i trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st century pirates , who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .
i would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the commissioner and some of my colleagues .
i am referring to the double hull , which consists of two layers of steel , with containers divided into two tanks .
commissioner , there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called ' ecological hull ' in which case , in the event of an accident , the seawater penetrates the containers and , as a result of pressure , the oil is transferred to other tanks .
commissioner , i believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures .
it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries .
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .
mr president , commissioner , i think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us , after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings , finally to produce a joint resolution .
i think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .
on the other hand , parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me . i think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and i think that we are providing the commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a european maritime area .
i think that it is quite obvious , and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common airspace , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area .
i therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .
the commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .
i have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty , or the eurosceptic groups are calling for europe to regulate , and i think that this is in fact the right level to take action .
we sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
in this area we must respond to public opinion .
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
we must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the ' polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deterrent .
i have almost finished and i would like to say that i have personally requested a public hearing of the committee on transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .
i hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .
mr president , the oil tanker erika , the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on malta and probably in italy and greece and which was hired by total-fina for the transport of oil , foundered off the breton coastline , with disastrous consequences .
the implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous .
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .
the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection .
states can carry out port inspections .
in europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive .
however , it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
in my opinion , the commissioner is quite right .
where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed european commission ?
can the commission provide an assurance that directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all member states ?
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?
would it not be beneficial , in the short term , following the rotterdam model , to inspect according to a points system in which , for example , account is taken of the ship ' s age , whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience .
in short , to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .
the erika was built at a japanese shipyard and is single-hulled .
there are four more sister ships in service at present .
construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high .
some of them also sail under the maltese flag .
are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?
would sanctions not be appropriate , as the commissioner stated , for the classification society ?
rina is currently the talk of the town .
malta is entering the accession negotiations .
in my opinion , the european union can only accept malta if it is guaranteed that the maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .
i would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for questions to the commission .
mr president , just before i went down into the chamber , i received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a swedish woman who had chosen to spend new year ' s eve on the french coast in brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives .
like many other hundreds of volunteers , she had seen the destruction , washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there .
like so many others , i too wonder where the people responsible are .
where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur ?
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
this is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether intentional or unintentional .
( the president cut the speaker off )
i would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament .
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the erika off brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the british media .
although britain and france have had their differences recently , i can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .
tv pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife , in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks , have brought back memories of similar british disasters , such as the torrey canyon in 1967 , and have prompted many british volunteers to help .
i salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .
this is clearly a problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .
instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as lloyds of london , we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab .
ultimately , the polluter must pay .
in addition we must build on the council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at eu ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .
moreover , although i am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , i believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .
rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 eu directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .
i sincerely hope that , particularly during the french presidency later this year , the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options , and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament .
mr president , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as i have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force majeure .
the victims are waiting outside .
they want answers .
they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .
the citizens are right to ask : " do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? "
who will provide us with new jobs ?
when will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint european challenge .
that is why i welcome mrs palacio ' s action plan with open arms .
it is equally important to note that " prevention is better than cure " .
but there is an art to that as well .
deploying the german multipurpose ship " neuwerk " - it is right outside my front door in cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help .
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .
valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone .
we are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .
i have been fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in parliament .
the issue is as topical as it was before .
furthermore , i will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow meps , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation .
before the end of march , i propose to present a communication in which i will possibly present legislative texts , that is to say , amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the council and in parliament .
i would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem . there are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas .
they are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium . and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .
mrs roth-behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .
in fact , i believe that things have been done by the commission , but there is still more to do .
this was demonstrated by the americans who , after the exxon valdez disaster , within one year , adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as i said earlier , to divert ships unacceptable to american ports towards europe .
in europe , after the amoco cadiz , or the urquiola on the spanish coast , in 1976 , or the torrey canyon , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .
during these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .
that is the reality .
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from american legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .
i have referred to a series of issues which i will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when i present the actual initiatives in the coming months .
my intention is - and i insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of march , also coinciding with the council of ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six-month period of the portuguese presidency , for us to have texts to discuss .
flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
the romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community .
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a community register .
i believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the european union countries .
as for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as mr hatzidakis has said .
we already have legislation .
according to the information which the commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .
the problem is not that only 25 % are inspected , but rather how we select , how we find , the ships which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags .
unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily .
therefore , more than making amendments , we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done , apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews , especially in relation to the age of the different vessels .
and that is why we have solas ( the international convention for the safety of life at sea ) and marpol ( the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships ) , two conventions of the international maritime organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all member states of the union and whose application will have to be monitored .
with regard to the question of union inspectors , i believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the member states , which does not mean that the commission does not have to ensure that the states carry out their duty adequately .
lastly , i would like to stress the issue of liability .
not only in terms of maximum sums insured , which i believe should be similar to those in the united states .
we have set a figure of usd 180 million ; in the united states they are talking about usd 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
i believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the united states , but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shipowners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .
i will end now . i will not expand further .
we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .
but , obviously , as some speakers have said - and i thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years , we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done .
as for me , i can say , after having debated it in the college of commissioners , that the commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures , amendments and directives to parliament and the council , in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .
the political will of this parliament is required - and i can see that i can count on this - as well as that of the council of ministers .
thank you very much , commissioner .
we have taken good note of your intentions .
i have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present commission statement .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12.00 p.m.
storms in europe
the next item is the commission statement on the storms in europe .
mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission .
commissioner , i would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the european union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .
in the days immediately following this terrible storm i wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the french authorities to redraw the boundaries of objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in france and elsewhere could benefit from objective 2 .
i think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
in fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
we should therefore put this situation right immediately .
you also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .
let me explain .
i was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of deciduous forest .
indeed , for some ' forestry ' districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .
we know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .
i think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .
indeed , you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate .
on the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years .
those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
i am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is , and i thank the commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .
i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophes are still to come .
as you yourself said , commissioner , these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
mr president , everyone who has travelled here by car , train or aeroplane , has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in france , caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck europe at the end of last month .
what can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?
firstly , i would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services .
they have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens .
next , i would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the union ' s member states who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their french colleagues .
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
if this disaster had taken place in guatemala or turkey , we could have immediately used the community budget to help the victims , but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so .
we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authorities and individual states from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying community competition rules too strictly .
i am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
as you said , commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to fifg for investments that have been totally wiped out .
beyond this , i think that implementing magps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .
i therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .
mr president , the storms which devastated france during the night between 26 and 27 december have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of ff 75 billion , i.e. eur 11 billion .
almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones , 500 000 hectares of forestry land , or 100 million cubic metres of forest , have been ruined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the park at the palace of versailles demonstrates .
it seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and european solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .
we know full well that what you are doing , commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the structural funds of the new objective 2 or from the provisional objectives 2 or 5b .
these are the terms of the written answer you gave mr martinez on 11 january 2000 .
i can show you a copy if you wish .
we would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the commission , but also of this parliament , and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so .
but for pity ' s sake , and i am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms .
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .
we must use the berlin summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the union . that , however , is another problem altogether .
mr president , commissioner , europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december .
these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region , lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .
i would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their troubles are not yet over .
it is europe 's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of member states affected by the disaster .
i welcome mr barnier ' s statement and i also welcome the measures which the commission has announced .
i am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .
the community action programme for civil protection , established by a council decision on 9 december , was launched on 1 january 2000 .
i ask member states to grasp this opportunity . this programme must work at full capacity .
although it may have been effective in certain areas - and i do not doubt the sincerity of commissioner barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry .
our priority , as we wait for community-level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between member states .
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood .
finally , it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls .
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states .
this aid for gathering timber is , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas .
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .
this is a very sad opportunity for europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies .
it is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between member states in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .
hurricane " lothar " should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too .
current programmes must be accelerated .
for example , as they stand , the commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under kyoto .
the trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shelves it .
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the white paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .
the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate !
commissioner , mr president , lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .
however , it has now achieved notoriety .
the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in france and germany , but also in switzerland , leaving a trail of destruction in its wake .
the wind triumphed over electricity pylons , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany .
if mrs schreyer is to visit the black forest sometime in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to help him as an individual .
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?
what answer will the commission give , when it is on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc . ?
all this is well-intentioned advice .
however , i come from an area in northern germany where the forestry industry predominates and i can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .
the thinning-out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree .
what we need the commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .
mr president , commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .
firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , nato , with the participation of most member states of the european union , flattened kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom .
we are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .
secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the eu .
the commission in brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders .
" we do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .
this is wrong !
and no one can comprehend this attitude .
certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity , also from within this community .
i say they have a right to solidarity .
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .
it knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the commission the fact that what most brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will .
permit me one further comment . although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm , the tanker disaster off the french coast has made it very clear that we need to give the commission a helping hand on another matter .
the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations .
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
then , for example , people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart .
when , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament , i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
to this day i am still awaiting an initiative from the commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
it is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and i hope that february does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !
mr president , commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems .
it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .
there have always been natural disasters and there always will be .
of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
there is certainly a need for european civil protection , and the eu budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .
but , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature cannot make mistakes .
the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests .
of course , i am in favour of providing assistance where we can .
but when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground .
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .
to this day , we in europe remain in the privileged position of having the gulf stream , and the gulf stream still does its stuff .
america and south-east asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go .
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream .
but in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .
this is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference .
we must reduce co2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of europe are faring .
mr president , i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .
this is an irreparable loss .
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the french departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with france , which is the country worst affected .
as i have little time , mr president , i would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .
i believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .
therefore europe must be clearly committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals .
secondly , i was rapporteur for civil protection in europe and i completely agree with the commissioner ' s proposal to create a european civil protection body .
furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by european standards .
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .
i want to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at european level to give assistance to member states and regions that have tragedies like this .
that is important .
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past . it was very small .
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major .
officials and ministers from member states were coming to brussels , whispering with the commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies .
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .
i think we should reinstate this budget line .
when we had the earthquake in greece , which was a big disaster , the community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks .
the same when the floods came in france and the same again now .
these are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .
we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the atlantic .
we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these .
ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .
it is true that there was a joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines .
it is also true that there is a lot of european money around . commissioner barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in article 87 ( 2 ) of the treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the structural funds .
it is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
it is nothing more than the states playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul .
this is inadequate , and i am personally delighted that mr barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , i expressed when i told the press in bordeaux what i am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of european civil security .
if the european citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being , if the mandate that our president , mrs fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the union and europe ' s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency .
i therefore believe that a european civil protection force , real civil relief blue helmets , who would go to areas in difficulty within the union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the union if needs be , in venezuela or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see .
i would like to tell commissioner barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly european in spirit .
mr president , commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that europe gets off relatively lightly .
nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .
anyone travelling to strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in alsace as well .
i would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously , and at the same time , from my position here in this chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .
each and every one of us knows that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .
for instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle ' s larvae , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives .
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
the calculations are in decades rather than years .
in addition , i would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .
i am therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
( the president cut the speaker off )
mr president , i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank .
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland .
we had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of e.coli-infected water .
i talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water .
natural habitats were destroyed .
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case .
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe .
for the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of europe , and i believe we need , in the long-term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .
we certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way .
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
as has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe .
of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing , these storms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century .
i believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours , tom spencer . he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .
however , an exception should certainly be made in the case of shell and bp , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability .
we must be aware of this connection ; i do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course !
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .
that concludes the debate .
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday .
food safety
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .
mr president , i am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to parliament the main lines of the commission 's white paper on food safety , adopted on wednesday last , 12 january , in association with my colleague , mr liikanen .
at my hearing last september , i promised speedy delivery of this white paper .
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september .
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission 's green paper on food law was published .
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the bse crisis .
the white paper also reflects the concerns of this parliament which you have outlined to both president prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this house since the commission was appointed .
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe 's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .
the commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
when i launched the white paper last week i said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .
the most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of europe .
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .
this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .
in an industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects .
between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
this crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and european level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .
the challenge is to make the system the very best .
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders .
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation . all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
the detailed action plan on food safety in the white paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .
over 80 measures are envisaged .
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
it has already attracted much comment , including reactions from members of parliament .
the chapter of the white paper devoted to the establishment of a european food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments . we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage .
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
the commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .
why should a european food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
the first key concern is independence .
key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the bse crisis .
however , the commission believes that we must go further .
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority 's establishment .
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .
as the white paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .
i am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
to be proactive the white paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority .
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .
the commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission , parliament and council .
i make no apology for this approach ; i firmly believe that it is the correct one .
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority .
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
it was only last year that the treaty was amended to give parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter .
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
i also reject this line of argument . how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
would this be in the interests of europe 's citizens ?
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
i have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the member states .
this is a major task .
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union .
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .
however , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre-eminent on the european stage .
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard .
as an integral part of a value-added structure , the white paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that member states and operators are complying with community legislation .
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in dublin .
this revised community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at community level , community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
as part of our proposals in this area - which i expect to bring forward at the end of this year - i will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the commission . these could include withholding community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a member state .
these proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the union .
in addition to the proposals for a new european food authority and an enhanced control system at community-level , the white paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the community 's legislation , covering all aspects of food products from farm to table .
it sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminants and residues , novel food , additives , flavourings , packaging and irradiation .
as regards the precautionary principle , i might add that the commission is currently finalising a communication which i expect to be adopted very soon .
i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .
however , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , i recognise that this was not feasible .
but i know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the white paper 's proposals on the authority .
we now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the commission 's ideas on the white paper on the establishment of a european food authority .
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate . parliament played a crucial role in europe 's response to the bse crisis .
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .
i expect that parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
while we have a number of months to the end of april to debate the issue and garner our views , i recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
it is essential that the commission should have the benefit of parliament 's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the european union 's food safety regime .
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu 's food safety regime in the years ahead .
it is essential that we get the mix right .
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institutions , including the commission and parliament .
that is very much the right approach .
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight . i hope that we can thrash this out .
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
it is very important that we include liability in that process .
that is the one word i am talking about .
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
that cannot continue .
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .
mr president , it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
you are unclear about this in your white paper .
what is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
the final part of my question is as follows : when will bse testing be binding in all member states ?
that is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your white paper .
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .
i think the lines that you have set up regarding the food safety authority are a recognition of reality .
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
however , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , i have to ask : if europe has the safest food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from brussels and under-implementation in the member states ? we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
regarding enlargement : what plans does the commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the white paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?
president , first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern , mrs roth-behrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper .
i find that encouraging and i look forward to further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability .
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
i have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .
mrs roth-behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
at the moment the list is , as i say , a negative list and it is added to as required .
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
this is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .
the work in relation to bse in member states and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in member states is ongoing , i know that mrs roth-behrendt has asked me this question before and i said i thought it was coming along quickly but i understand it is in inter-service consultation in the commission and work is currently under way .
i hope that the next time you ask me the question , i will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation .
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that i have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen .
commissioner , the ignorance of certain member states has landed us in a major food crisis here in europe , and i am afraid that once more i have cause to be angry at the fact that again no members of the council are in attendance , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .
what i would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .
of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but i would insist on parliament retaining the rights accorded it under maastricht and amsterdam , and even extending them .
i very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and i hope it does not come to that .
i also welcome the white paper .
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france 's refusal to lift the ban ?
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting .
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment ?
mr president , you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future eu food agency should not be located on the periphery , but you did not mention what that periphery was .
for example , the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .
it has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers .
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union .
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
in relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .
i envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september .
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september .
i do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work .
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that .
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .
there may be a number of views on that .
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament - or indeed parliament nominees - to be members of the board .
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament , through nominees or even meps themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
mr florenz also raised the question of anonymity .
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
it must be visible . it must be known .
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority .
the ceo of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition , diet and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority .
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .
it must be visible .
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
i suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end .
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level .
that is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .
but information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .
over time , as i said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged .
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence .
it is something that is earned over a period of time .
however , the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission , parliament and council .
i realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the authority is - i believe - the way forward .
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .
in relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling .
in relation to mrs lynne 's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues .
mrs myller then asked me about the location of the authority .
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .
i recognise that the feo is located in dublin and , although i come from that part of the world myself , i have to accept that it is not the centre of europe !
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority .
the fvo is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in dublin .
the food safety authority 's situation is quite different .
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation .
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .
equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified .
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .
scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based .
that is my judgement at the moment .
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and i will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery .
colleagues , i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the conference of presidents .
if you feel that these sessions after a commission statement are important , i would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them .
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had 29 minutes of response by the commissioner , and his statement .
as you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
i hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the commission on such future occasions .
that concludes the debate .
question time ( commission )
the next item is question time ( b5-0003 / 2000 ) .
we will examine questions to the commission .
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time .
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .
mr purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .
i object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for question time ; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and i do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda .
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
first part
question no 28 by ( h-0781 / 99 ) :
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than 7 on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey 's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .
turkey 's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey 's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan .
what steps will the commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget ?
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu , turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .
according to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .
the commission acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting , construction , commissioning , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in turkey rests entirely with the turkish atomic energy authority .
the commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .
as commissioner wallström indicated during the hearings in the european parliament in september 1999 , the commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the turkish government in the future and i am happy to inform you that i will have a meeting with the turkish foreign minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue .
in particular , the commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .
according to information received from the international atomic agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in june 1998 in adana .
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material .
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency .
thank you for your reply .
i should like to make the following points : turkey is now a candidate country .
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire cadou type reactors from canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india .
in this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology .
so much for the political aspect .
now to the technical aspect .
the safety factor in this type of project , and i am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
in cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .
however , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
in this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .
therefore , and given that the relationship between the european union and the commission and turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of turkey within the european union .
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .
i have explained the position of the commission .
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable .
in the case of turkey it is different .
the plant is not yet there .
i have already said that turkey is part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety .
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey .
if the conclusion is that turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with lithuania , slovakia and bulgaria .
mr president , the commissioner said that turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that turkey 's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the community , and would the commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with mr souladakis on this matter ?
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
i do not have these concerns .
i believe that turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in europe and i think it is quite right to discuss them here in parliament .
question no 29 by ( h-0786 / 99 ) :
subject : depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict ?
if not , why not ?
mrs wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission .
thank you , mr bowe , for your question .
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action .
as early as last june the commission financed a first study .
it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe .
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment .
the commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme - balkan task force .
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net .
the balkan task force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .
no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf fact-finding mission .
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .
from a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern europe .
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed . it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .
first of all , mr president , can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response .
clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and i am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
this uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war .
i would therefore ask the commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within kosovo ?
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
thank you , mr bowe , for that question .
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of kosovo .
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .
that is also mentioned in the report .
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia .
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the european union .
it is important to follow up and it gives the member states , as well as the united nations and the commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment .
it also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
mr president , commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday .
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?
i wish i could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately i am not able to .
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
that also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
i wanted to ask the commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the nato armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?
i cannot answer that question .
when it comes to medical checks and so on , i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .
what we know from the environmental side is what i have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-ups i do not have the information about that .
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
question no 30 by ( h-0793 / 99 ) :
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over 4000 tibetans who escaped over the himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .
many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .
the tibet intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the european union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by tibetans daily in tibet .
the tibet intergroup , therefore , gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in tibet and supporting the dalai lama ? s proposal for dialogue with the chinese government to resolve the situation in tibet , calls on the commission to appoint a special envoy for tibet to address the concerns of the european union and to help bring the tibetan and chinese authorities together for dialogue .
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet ?
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared .
i have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including tibet , firmly and candidly to the chinese authorities .
the european union did that at the european union ­ china summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues , including tibet .
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .
i urge the chinese again to do so .
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities .
we are also doing a number of other things : in the european union-china human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for tibetans .
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
but for my part , i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the tibetan community in exile .
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .
mr president , mr patten , of course , you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in china , and you are well aware of how hard the tibetans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto .
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to " mr cfsp " , that is , to mr solana , then i fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter .
your approach , which i am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; i wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .
if we cut down here and say that the council now shares responsibility for this , then i fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the european commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the council .
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is .
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council .
as it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the council makes the appointment .
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .
i am very much hoping in the next few months that the commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in china or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the european union .
i have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world .
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet .
during the few months that i have been a commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in new york at our meeting with minister tang and most recently at the meeting in peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest .
if i can make a literary commendation to the honourable member , who i recognise is interested in these subjects , i recommend to him a book published just before christmas written by isabel hilton , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of tibet .
mr president , i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness .
we are not just talking about human rights and the environment where tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , serenity , compassion - as the dalai lama would say - to us europeans .
the question before us now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness , the dalai lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair ?
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people .
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the buddhist tradition .
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama .
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .
the commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama .
at or around the time of president clinton 's visit to china , the president of the people 's republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .
it would be very beneficial , not just for tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government of the people 's republic of china if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .
question no 31 by ( h-0795 / 99 ) :
subject : commission 's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the eu according to newspaper reports , the commission has rejected the proposal by eu ombudsman jacob söderman for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the eu .
although the commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .
are these reports accurate ?
what is the reason for the commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of eu administration ?
does the commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between parliament and the commission in september , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows parliament to express an opinion on it ?
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .
in november 1999 the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure .
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
it should be noted that the new commission gave an immediate follow-up to the european ombudsman decision of 28 july 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code .
the commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman .
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission 's administration with the public .
it will be adopted through a legally-binding commission decision to be published in the official journal of the european communities .
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman 's office .
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself .
however , it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .
the newspaper reports were misleading .
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman .
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and i think we are soundly placed on that .
i want to repeat that honourable members , like the honourable member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member .
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer .
for safety ' s sake , i should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of jacob söderman ' s proposal which the commission thinks is unacceptable .
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
" i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman 's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 " .
both documents , that is the commission 's document and the ombudsman 's draft , cover largely the same ground .
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue .
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the members to bear in mind .
as the author is not present , question no 32 lapses .
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . i am sorry .
according to the rules of procedure , you are not required to reply .
i wish you a good evening .
second part
questions to mr nielson , who is replaced by mr patten
questions 33 and 34 of questions to the commission were intended for mr nielson .
mr nielson cannot be present today since he is in south africa .
i must tell you that the vice-president of the commission , mrs loyola de palacio , has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that mr patten will reply to the questions .
question no 33 by ( h-0829 / 99 ) :
subject : ' mainstreaming ' in eu aid policy in 1995 the council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ( ' mainstreaming ' ) into the full range of eu aid policy .
the guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in ' gender mainstreaming ' but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the directorate-general for development .
' mainstreaming ' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
to achieve that , the council 's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety .
current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days ' training in such issues should form an essential part of the directorate-general for development 's introductory courses for new staff .
is the commission prepared to take such measures ?
can i first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , mr nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with south africa survives .
the commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so-called induction courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , i admit , on a regular basis .
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on .
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate-general for development at all levels . it is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add-on " .
this must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .
it would appear that we are in agreement about this .
however , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers .
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .
extremely few members of the directorate-general for development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .
only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
that is naturally unacceptable .
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .
as i point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
my question is this : is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate-general for development ?
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson .
i must not go on about books , but i have just been reading the book by david landis barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back millennia .
secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the commission - it should be essential .
and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .
that goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said .
i hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .
since 1991 , the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia .
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme .
in 1998 and 1999 kyrgyzstan , kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur 75 million .
this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .
security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .
in addition to national programmes , the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
food security programmes in central asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind .
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , tajikistan .
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
over the same period , kyrgyzstan received eur 17 million .
since 1993 the commission 's european community humanitarian office , echo , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
in 1998 and 1999 eur 3.8 million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .
